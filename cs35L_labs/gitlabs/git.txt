The main difference is that eggert's directory has more branches when compared to the one that I cloned.
Even though we both point to master, eggert has
  next
  seen
  todo
as branches below and maint above.
git clone for me only takes the local branch for master which is why when you run git branch -r on eggert and
my own directories, the show the same result.
