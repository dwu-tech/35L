I first started with the tag, 2.33.1. I ran git log and searched for the tag which gave the commit id
af6d1d602a. This let me know that this was the commit id, I could run git log on that to find the author.

The author and date where
Author: Junio C Hamano <gitster@pobox.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 12 13:51:59 2021 -0700

Now that I have that, I ran git format-patch, this resulted in around 600 lines.
I ran it again but piped it into grep diff to find occurences of diff.
I saw one of the files mentioned a segfault.

The final command I ran was git format-patch | grep segfault
this results in one file,
0572-mergetools-xxdiff-prevent-segfaults-from-stopping-di.patch

I concluded that this was the patch that fixed the issue with git diff --relative as
they mentioned the error was a segfault, and the name of the patch involves preventing segfaults


After examining that patch file, I concluded that both David Aguilar and June C Hamano 
Signed off on the patch 572.
